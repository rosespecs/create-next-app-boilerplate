# Boilerplate NextJS app ðŸš€

Slimed down [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) app.

## On top of create-next-app this boilerplate includes

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

## Why?

I do the same thing every time I start a NextJS project therefore, it's time for a boilerplate!
